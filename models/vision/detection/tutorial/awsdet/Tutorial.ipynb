These are the same weights included in the Keras package. We download them manually for stability, because they are sometimes retrained between versions of Keras. The script will download everything to the Sagemaker notebook instance, assemble everything in the file structure the training script expects to see, archives it, and saves it to your S3 bucket."

Most of the time, you can use Sagemaker's built in containers, but for customized models you could have to create your own.\n",

    "`instance_count` number of instances (nodes) for training.\n",

    "`instance_type` the type of EC2 instances that will be used for training. For highest performance use `ml.p3dn.24xlarge`. The `ml.p3.16xlarge` and `ml.p3.8xlarge` are slightly lower performance while being more cost effective. The `g4dn.12xlarge` instance type is even lower cost, but much slower than the p3 instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "`num_workers_per_host` number of training jobs per instance. This should be the number of GPUs on an instance, so should be set to 8 for `ml.p3dn.24xlarge` or `ml.p3.16xlarge` instances, and 4 for `ml.p3.8xlarge` or `g4dn.12xlarge`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`amp_enabled` refers to whether a model should train using mixed precision. Mixed precision training is supported on p3 and g4 instances.\n",

    "`warmup_steps` number of steps for which the learning rate will be increased from `learning_rate * warmup_ratio` to `learning_rate`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`optimizer` this is the configuration for an `tf.keras.optimizers` optimizer. The `learning_rate` specified here is the learning rate adjusted for 8 GPUs after warmup steps. If you have more than 8 GPUs then this rate will be scaled linearly automatically.\n",
