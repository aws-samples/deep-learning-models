## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Changelog (this file).
- BERT model.
- Weights & Biases integration.
- Draft of ELECTRA model.

### Changed
- SageMaker and Kubernetes Dockerfiles have been merged into one.
- Use the module system rather than $PYTHONPATH, so jobs are launched with `python -m albert.run_pretraining` instead of `python albert/run_pretraining.py`.
- NLP models use `--per_gpu_batch_size` instead of `--batch_size`.
- NLP scripts start training at step 1 instead of step 0. So a job with `--total_steps=100` will run steps [1..100] instead of [0..99].
- NLP transformers dependency is now pinned to 2.11.0 instead of a custom fork. This removes the `--pre_layer_norm=true` option.

### Removed
- NGC GPUMonitor Dockerfile.
