# --- Section 2: [Command Line Arguments] ---
#

# Use the command line argument "cfgFile=/etc/anotherconfig.conf" to
# specify a different config file for beegfs_admon.
# All other options in this file can also be used as command line
# arguments, overriding the corresponding config file values.


#
# --- Section 3: [Basic Settings Documentation] ---
#

# [sysMgmtdHost]
# Hostname (or IP) of the host running the management service.
# (See also "connMgmtdPortUDP" and "connMgmtdPortTCP")
# Default: <none>


#
# --- Section 4: [Advanced Settings Documentation] ---
#

#
# --- Section 4.1: [Mon] ---
#

# [dbHostName]
# The hostname where the InfluxDB backend runs.
# Default: localhost

# [dbPort]
# The port on which the time series InfluxDB listens.
# connections.
# Default: 8086

# [dbDatabase]
# The database name in which the data is stored.
# Default: beegfs_mon

# [dbMaxPointsPerRequest]
# Sets the max number of points that will be cached until the whole
# set is sent to the InfluxDB backend. After a whole set of statistics has been
# collected, the cached points will be sent in any case. Small values lead to
# many sent packets, too big ones can exceed the max package size that the
# InfluxDB HTTP server accepts.
# Default: 5000

# [dbSetRetentionPolicy]
# Determines whether the service shall automatically apply a retention policy
# to the database at startup. This should only be set to false if the user wants
# to configure the database by himself and wants to have a more sophisticated
# retention policy.
# Default: true

# [dbRetentionDuration]
# Defines how long the data points shall be stored until dropped by InfluxDB.
# This is only relevant if dbSetRetentionPolicy is set to true.
# Valid values are in the form ^[0-9]+[smhdw]$, while the suffixes mean
# seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks. 2d, for example, means two days.
# For more details please consult the InfluxDB documentation.
# Default: 1h (one hour)

# [collectClientOpsByNode]
# Sets wether mon collects the client ops stats from the nodes, grouped by the client node IP.
# Default: true

# [collectClientOpsByUser]
# Sets wether mon collects the client ops stats from the nodes, grouped by the clients user ID.
# Default: true

# [statsRequestIntervalSecs]
# Sets the waiting interval in seconds between the stats query operation in seconds.
# This does not affect the the high resolution stats (which is always measured in
# one second intervals).
# Default: 5

# [httpTimeoutMSecs]
# Defines the timeout for the http requests that are sent to the InfluxDB daemon
# in milliseconds.
# Default: 1000

# [nodelistRequestIntervalSecs]
# Sets the waiting interval in seconds between the nodelist requests operation
# in seconds. This defines how often the service pulls the newest node lists from
# the management daemon.
# Default: 30

#
# --- Section 4.2: [Connections & Communication] ---
#

# [connMgmtdPortTCP], [connMgmtdPortUDP]
# The UDP and TCP ports of the management node.
# Default: 8008

# [connPortShift]
# Shifts all following UDP and TCP ports according to the specified value.
# Intended to make port configuration easier in case you do not want to
# configure each port individually.
# Default: 0

# [connAuthFile]
# The path to a file that contains a shared secret for connection based
# authentication. Only peers that use the same shared secret will be able to
# connect.
# Default: <none>

# [connFallbackExpirationSecs]
# The time in seconds after which a connection to a fallback interface expires.
# When a fallback connection expires, the system will try to establish a new
# connection to the other hosts  primary interface (falling back to another
# interface again if necessary).
# Note: The priority of node interfaces can be configured using the
#    "connInterfacesFile" parameter.
# Default: 900

# [connMaxInternodeNum]
# The maximum number of simultaneous connections to the same node.
# Default: 3

# [connInterfacesFile]
# The path to a text file that specifies the names of the interfaces, which
# may be used for communication by other nodes. One interface per line. The
# line number also defines the priority of an interface.
# Example: "ib0" in the first line, "eth0" in the second line.
# Values: This setting is optional. If unspecified, all available interfaces
#    will be published and priorities will be assigned automatically.
# Note: This has no influence on outgoing connections. The information is sent
#    to other hosts to inform them about possible communication paths.
# Default: <none>

# [connNetFilterFile]
# The path to a text file that specifies allowed IP subnets, which may be used
# for outgoing communication. One subnet per line in classless notation (IP
# address and number of significant bits).
# Example: "192.168.10.0/24" in the first line, "192.168.20.0/24" in the second
#    line.
# Values: This setting is optional. If unspecified, all addresses are allowed
#    for outgoing communication.
# Default: <none>

# [connTcpOnlyFilterFile]
# The path to a text file that specifies IP address ranges to which no RDMA connection should be
# established. This is useful e.g. for environments where all hosts support RDMA, but some hosts
# cannot connect via RDMA to some other hosts.
# Example: "192.168.10.0/24" in the first line, "192.168.20.0/24" in the second
#    line.
# Values: This setting is optional.
# Default: <none>

#
# --- Section 4.3: [Logging] ---
#

# [logType]
# Defines the logger type. This can either be "syslog" to send log messages to
# the general system logger or "logfile". If set to logfile, logs will be written
# to logStdFile.
# Default: logfile

# [logLevel]
# Defines the amount of output messages. The higher this level, the more
# detailed the log messages will be.
# Note: Levels above 2 might decrease performance.
# Default: 2 (Max: 5)

# [logNoDate]
# Defines whether "date & time" (=false) or the current "time only" (=true)
# should be logged.
# Default: false

# [logNumLines]
# The maximum number of lines per log file.
# Default: 50000

# [logNumRotatedFiles]
# The number of old files to keep when "logNumLines" is reached and the log file
# is rewritten. (Log rotation)
# Default: 2

# [logStdFile]
# The path and filename of the log file for standard log messages. If no name
# is specified, the messages will be written to the console.
# Default: /var/log/beegfs-admon.log


#
# --- Section 4.4: [Startup] ---
#

# [runDaemonized]
# Detach the process from its parent (and from stdin/-out/-err).
# Default: true


#
# --- Section 4.5: [Tuning] ---
#

# [tuneNumWorkers]
# The number of worker threads. Should be at least 3. A value of up to twice the
# number of CPU cores of your machine is the recommended choice.
# Default: 4
